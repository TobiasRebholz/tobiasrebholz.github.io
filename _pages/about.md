My name is Tobias Rebholz. I am a quantitative psychologist and econometrician, working as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Tübingen in Germany. In 2023, I received my PhD from the transregional, DFG-funded research training group "Statistical Modeling in Psychology"" (SMiP), also from the University of Tübingen. My research interests include quantitative methods, social cognition, and judgment and decision-making, particularly in the context of information sampling and utilization.
